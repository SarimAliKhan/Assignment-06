    "#3. Modifiability: it is easy to make minor changes in the data representation or the procedures in an OO program. Changes inside a class do not affect any other part of a program, since the only public interface that the external world has to a class is through the use of methods; \n",
    "#4. Extensibility: adding new features or responding to changing operating environments can be solved by introducing a few new objects and modifying some existing ones; \n",
    "#5. Maintainability: objects can be maintained separately, making locating and fixing problems easier; \n",
